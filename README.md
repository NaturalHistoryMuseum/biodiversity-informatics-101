#### Scope and outputs

##### This class will familiarise participants with some of the platforms, tools and methodologies practised within the biodiversity informatics landscape.  

##### Students will utilise a suite of freely available tools to parse open data sources, analyse and restructure the information, and publish their datasets online in forms that enable scientific reuse of the data.


By the end of the class, students will have a basic understanding of:

- Key occurrence and observation data portals ([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/))
- How to manipulate data in Python. 
- How to work with [DarwinCore Archive](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) files
- How to map the data with Geopandas and KeplerGL



##### Open Jupyter notebook

The Jupyter notebook is hosted online on Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NaturalHistoryMuseum/biodiversity-informatics-101/master?filepath=occurrence.ipynb)
