    <abstract>
        <para>Beetle records from Sussex shared by various recorders, most notably Peter Hodge - the Sussex County Recorder for Beetles - who has contributed over 65,000 records to this dataset and invested huge amounts of time in verifying the Sussex beetle records. Grant funding from Natural England enabled SxBRC to conduct a large-scale consultation with Sussex beetle recorders and secure the necessary permissions to publish beetle recorders&amp;#39; records at full resolution under a CC-BY licence. This dataset does not include ALL Sussex beetle records held by SxBRC, only those records were we have appropriate permission to share the records under a CC-BY licence, in accordance with the NBN guidance for adding historic data to the NBN Atlas. If you have recorded beetles in Sussex and would like your records to appear in this dataset, please contact SxBRC.</para>

                    <para>This dataset is comprised of records which have been shared with SxBRC, collected in a variety of ways. The data comes from a range of sources including some national beetle recording scheme organisers, professional entomologists and casual recorders.</para>

                    <para>Medium/high level of confidence. The dataset has been reviewed locally by Peter Hodge, the Sussex County Recorder for Beetles. Due to limited time available for verification, less attention was devoted to reviewing records of common and widespread species. The dataset as a whole has not been reviewed by national beetle recording scheme organisers, although some individual recorders will have sought confirmation of their determinations from national experts.</para>
